#Experimentation Steps that have been covered in this project:

1.Train with Linear Kernel: Run svm_training.py to see how SVM separates linearly separable data.
2.Experiment with Non-Linear Kernels: Run svm_kernel.py to see how SVM handles non-linear data using an RBF kernel.
3.Evaluate Performance: Run svm_evaluation.py to measure accuracy and confusion matrix for your model.
4.Tune Parameters: Experiment with:

C: C is a Regularization parameter (higher values = stricter margin).
gamma: It controls the influence of points in RBF kernel.
